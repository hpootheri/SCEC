From R. Zinke: two prominent fault strands pass through a channel ~10 m of of Point 432. On the southern strand, there is no discernible right-lateral offset of the contact between the channel bed's pebbly gravels, and the silty channel shoulder. On the northern strand, there could be equivocal evidence for ~5 cm of right-lateral offset as indicated by separation across a small releasing bend, as indicated below.

836,,Tectonic,"Source: Napa 2014; Railroad tracks offset on wide fault zone. Fault zone broadens from 35 m in bedrock (to south) to a 100 m wide zone at track. Most deformation in two fault zones 31 m wide. Surveyed the centerline berm and southern edge of track (gravel edge).  Western fault zone has about 2 m wide aperture, and offset range of 52-65 cm.  Eastern fault zone is more challenging to measure as it requires projection across 10 m wide curve in railroad track (note track azimuth on either side are non-parallel, tracks in center appear rotated). Thus, this wider aperture range is 214-233 cm. Summing these values the offset is 278-285 cm across 12 m of two fault apertures.  Correct offset likely higher; the change in track azimuth in center could reflect rotation or accommodation of diffuse shear in alluvium.  Comparison of measured features provides formal uncertainties of 20 cm; this is increased to 50 cm to reflect curvature and diffuse definition of features (i.e., survey tracks not smooth).  ; Additional: Observed Feature: Railroad tracks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-07-24T00:00:00-07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-07-03 13:34:40.304306,K.

From R. Zinke: two prominent fault strands pass through a channel ~10 m of of Point 432. On the southern strand, there is no discernible right-lateral offset of the contact between the channel bed's pebbly gravels, and the silty channel shoulder. On the northern strand, there could be equivocal evidence for ~5 cm of right-lateral offset as indicated by separation across a small releasing bend, as indicated below.

1966,KSG7-02,Tectonic,"Source: Ridgecrest 2019; Railroad tracks offset on wide fault zone. Fault zone broadens from 35 m in bedrock (to south) to a 100 m wide zone at track. Most deformation in two fault zones 31 m wide. Surveyed the centerline berm and southern edge of track (gravel edge).  Western fault zone has about 2 m wide aperture, and offset range of 52-65 cm.  Eastern fault zone is more challenging to measure as it requires projection across 10 m wide curve in railroad track (note track azimuth on either side are non-parallel, tracks in center appear rotated). Thus, this wider aperture range is 214-233 cm. Summing these values the offset is 278-285 cm across 12 m of two fault apertures.  Correct offset likely higher; the change in track azimuth in center could reflect rotation or accommodation of diffuse shear in alluvium.  Comparison of measured features provides formal uncertainties of 20 cm; this is increased to 50 cm to reflect curvature and diffuse definition of features (i.e., survey tracks not smooth).  ; Additional: Obs Affiliation: USGS; Team Id: '07/24-1'; Team: S.

Full fault zone is 57 m, but most discrete slip concentrated on single strand in 9 m wide main fault zone.  Gully is fault-normal upstream (west) of main fault strand, turns northerly within 2 m of main fault before offset several meters.  Where gully surveyed within fault zone, it trends ENE, and then irregularly continues across western edge of main fault zone. Largest offset resolved between intermediate aperture section of fault normal trends of gully (563 cm); smallest offset is 322 cm measured at center of main fault zone using narrowest aperture. Given the short section of west gully in fault zone, the largest value seems somewhat unlikely (a more reasonable interpretion would use longer trend of gully to determine 497 cm), but also know the survey missed deformation shown in KSG7-07 on western edge of fault zone.
